How It Works?
Our model follows the Plain CNN architecture. The network is made of stacked convolutional layers. The figure gives the general overview of our network. Each block seen in the figure is composed of two to three convolutional layers followed by a rectified-linear activation unit. Between blocks, a batch normalization layer is inserted to help prevent exploding or vanishing gradient problems and speed up convergence.
